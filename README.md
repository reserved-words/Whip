# Whip
A highly personalised WPF music player which is a perpetual work in progress. This does (or will eventually do) everything I want a music player to do, but is unlikely to be of any use or interest to anyone else. 

Do not download or run this as it may overwrite your ID3 tags overwritten and your music collection ruined.
